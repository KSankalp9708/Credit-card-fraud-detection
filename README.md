## Objective
To build a machine learning model for **detecting fraudulent credit card transactions** using the Kaggle dataset.
---
## Approach
- Imported and preprocessed the dataset using **pandas** and **numpy**.  
- Analyzed **class imbalance** between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.  
- Split data into training and testing sets with stratified sampling.  
- Trained a **Logistic Regression model** using scikit-learn.  
- Evaluated performance with accuracy score.  
---
## Results
- Achieved ~94.5% accuracy in detecting fraud despite the highly imbalanced dataset.  
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of logistic regression for binary classification in financial fraud detection.
